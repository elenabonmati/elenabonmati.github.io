<p> I am currently a doctoral candidate in Romance Studies at the University of Miami. I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Alicante in Spain where I was granted the opportunity to participate in a year-long study abroad program at Manchester Metropolitan University (England) as well as a semester abroad at the University of South Australia (Australia). In addition, I have also completed a Master’s in teaching English as a Foreign Language at the University of Alicante and MA in Spanish at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.

My areas of interest are nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first century Spanish literature, Cultural studies, Queer theory, and Digital Humanities. In my dissertation, I am focused on the popularity of Spanish “sicalipsis” (erotic popular literature) in the early twentieth century.

Thanks to my experiences as a Fulbright FLTA at Lincoln University (2011-2012), the first HSBU university in the USA, I have participated and coordinated numerous community-based activities. These activities enabled me to work directly with the students and become involved in the community at large. I have continued my community involvement in the last few years by volunteering and participating actively with LGBTQI community in the Valencian Region in Spain during the summers. In particular, I volunteer to give talks and do activities at different high schools.
