## Spanish Anarchist Press in 20s-30s

### 1) Overview of the project

In this project, I aim to enrich former literary and historical discussions of early twentieth-century anarchist production in Spain. I approach the investigation of this epoch through the analysis of the cultural products that do not belong to the intellectual elites, analyzing, instead, a variety of popular sources such as journals and magazines. In particular, I am using text analysis to consider how theories of sexuality may or may not have influenced the anarchist movement. 

For this reason, I have used a sample data of 30 articles published in the anarchist magazine *Estudios* (1928-1936) that were printed in Valencia, Spain. My questions to this particular corpus are:
     	
- What are the main discussions in these anarchist magazines? 
- How (if at all) did the anarchist magazines shape or contribute to the vulgarization of sexology and promote the sexual “education” of the masses during the early twentieth century?



### 2) Methodology

Ted Underwood explains that “topic modeling gives us a way to infer the latent structure behind a collection of documents.” My final goal with this project is to be able to process a bigger corpus of texts from the early twentieth-century in Spanish. In a manner, the use of topic modeling will enable me to compare anarchist and erotic magazines, and also, to look into how the topics may have changed over the period of time that I am discussing.
 
In this first approach to my analysis of a greater corpus, I have used text mining techniques to help me understanding and decipher the most highlighted features of this small corpus of anarchist’s articles. As Shlomo Argamon, et al. explains “Text mining techniques are commonly used to detect patterns in large numbers of documents. These tools are often used to classify documents based on a training sample and apply the resulting model to unseen data.” (Argamon, et al.). For this first trial to analyze a small corpus of articles from the anarchist magazine Estudios, I have used the tool Voyant. While this is a very basic tool, it has provided me with new insights to the corpus of anarchism in relation to sexual education and how anarchist ideology deals with female and male sexuality. Lisa Marie Rhody promotes and discusses how feminist approaches in literary studies can also be applied to text analysis, claiming that  “the language of feminist analysis, which challenges traditional modes of knowledge production, is well aligned with the practice of defamiliarizing a textual corpora in order to ask “new” questions at different scales.” In this brief analysis, I will try to understand and conceptualize what the major trends are in this corpus.

### 3) Results and discussion

##### a) Wordcloud View

- Most frequent words in the corpus: sexual (230); mujer (187); hombre (162); vida (157); sexo (113)

<iframe style='width: 717px; height: 254px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Summary/?stopList=keywords-ff8bbe08877fb8dcecdaa023b98271e0&corpus=d33675203f6db2d105141f690d575913'></iframe>


From this Word Cloud viewer, the most used words in this corpus are: “hombre”, “mujer”, “vida”, “sexo” and “sexual”. Other recurrent words are: “amor, nuestro, moral, social, educación, niño, espíritu, años, sexualidad, feminidad, matrimonio, madre..." From this first look, this corpus shows that the importance is given to sexualily and educacion. The question that this data arises seems to be why would anarchist magazines deal and problematize science and sexuality? For this reason, I am looking at the different conceptions and attributes given to sexuality related to men and women. 

In particular, while the word “men” is important in this word cloud, this corpus of anarchist texts seems to be be more interested in “women,” as they are more mentioned. Indeed, there seems to be an interest in women sexuality, and with words related to “feminidad”, “madres”, “educación”, “matrimonio” and even “moral”. These words show that the anarchist are trying to speak and impose a particular vision over women, since the great majority of authors in these articles are men.

In addition, the distinctive words above corresponding to each article, show that anarchist magazines are focused on sexual education in a twofold manner. They write about how men and women should behave, and that women are linked to “procreation, motherhood, marriage, hygiene”, but, and at the same time, they seem to pay attention to the ways in which the perils of “homosexuality, deviation, inversion, intersexuality” would affect society. 



### b) Trends

In this section, I am interested in looking at the relative frequencies of words across the corpus. For that reason, I have select particular words in order to compare them, such as: “amor* , problem* , homosex* , perver* ," to be compared to “ mujer* ” and “ hombre* ”. The discourses on science are related to the sexuality of women and men, but the interesting part is that women seem to be very closely related to homosexuality and love, whereas homosexuality in men is related to perversion.

### c) Terms and distributions


In this part, I am interested in looking at how words are connected with others, such as: hombre* , mujer* , amor* , inver* , homosex*.

- Hombre* 

![hombre](/assets/images/hombre.png "hombre")

- Mujer*

![mujer](/assets/images/mujer.png "mujer")

A first look at these images show that “hombre” occurs with “mujer”, “hombre/s” and “sexual”, while the most common phrases are: “hombre y mujer”, “hombres de ciencia” and “hombres de bien”. In the case of “women”, it not only refers to “man/men” but also to “feminidad” and “sexual”, and the common phrase “mujer de feminidad muy pura”. The first approximations show a controversial aspect, in fact, the anarchist movement is reproducing the bourgeois and capitalist model. While men are in charge of “science”, women are very much understood in a very essentialist manner, given  the phrase used for women.   

- Amor*

![amor](/assets/images/amor.png "amor")

- Invert*

![invert](/assets/images/inver.png "invert")

- Homosex*

![homosex](/assets/images/homosex.png "homosex")


Moving to the following words, the word amor* co-occurs with “mujer”, “pasión”, and “vida” which seems to highlight that amor is linked to women. In the case of homosexuality, the visualizations shows that the most recurrent collocates are:“inversión” and “perversión”, but it is also linked with “amor”. In a sense, that the word homosexuality co-occurs with “amor” disrupts and shows how same-sex relationships are seen not only in a pejorative manner, such as perversity; but also, in a positive manner such as “love”.  In addition, the relationship between words, seems to be closer to “mujer, sexual, sexo, ciencia.” Furthermore, the word inver* (inversión, invertido/a) occurs often with “hombre”, “homosexualismo”, “instinto”.


### d) Conclusion(s)  

With this project I want to intervene in the discussions of historical and literary critics of early twentieth-century Spain. Indeed, text mining would potentially offer me new ways of approaching my texts, since most critical analysis are very canonical and/or work with fewer text.

Since my first text analysis experiment, I have found a new perspective to trace social and political movements, such as the anarchist movement. It seems that Spanish anarchism influenced how knowledge about sexuality was disseminated to the majority of the population, which was not the educated or the elite. It seems that the sexual education that anarchist promoted is rooted in the differentiation of men and women, and determines that women are seen in terms of their reproductive capability. In this first approach, when homosexuality is linked to women, it is usually described  as “love”, while if homosexuality refers to men, it is portrayed as a perversity.
