## Ph.D. Research 

My dissertation underscores the connections among real life cases of same-sex relationships and the scandals that surrounded them; the popularity of Spanish erotic literature; and anarchist ideology in the early twentieth century. My investigation of this period focuses on an analysis of historical events and cultural products that neither belong to the intellectual elites nor are solely a product of Spanish origin (given earlier transnational influences, such as those of American women who participated in cultural and collegiate exchanges). Instead, I investigate several mass media sources: newspaper articles, magazines, short stories, lyrics of popular songs, letters, and novels. 


## Digital Projects

#### [Spanish Anarchist Press in 20s-30s](/research/Spanish_Press_Project/index.html) (Ongoing)

In my Digital Humanities Project I will analyze and examine different erotic Spanish and Catalan magazines, such as *Flirt* (1922-1923); *Muchas Gracias* (1924-1932), and *Papitiu* (1923-1926) and *La Chala* (1926-1933), through text analysis and topic modeling; as well as anarchist journals and magazines such as *La Revista Blanca* (1923-1936) and *Generación Consciente/Estudios* (1922-1936). I plan to examine magazines and journals, instead of erotic and anarchist novels and novelettes because of copyright issues, in addition, these magazines and journals had a broader public and they were cheaper. Indeed, through their numerous publications in the press, one can identify the themes and the topics related to sexuality.

My aim is to create a computer readable corpus of these erotic and anarchist magazines and journals, and second, to explore how anarchist movement and erotic literature influenced the population at the time. One of the questions that I want to answer is: How does a social and political movement, such as the anarchist movement, have relations to erotic literature? For that purpose, I plan to use topic modeling to establish topics and relations among erotic and anarchist materials to determine the influence on erotic fiction of the anarchists’ popularization of prevalent sexology through their magazines and journals.

#### [Epistemology of the Sea: Fisherman’s local knowledge](https://umiami.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=6d28d3b47f584d9795457d281c019420) (2017)

My main argument acknowledges why local knowledge produced by a fisherman in digital form matters and is relevant to the field of DH. Thus, I present this fisherman as a DH expert on the sea. Over the years, he has gathered, combined, collected, produced, created, and stored a great amount of information/data about his fishing areas and his surroundings in the Mediterranean Sea. In the study of spatial analysis, mapping has mostly focused on land and landscapes with regard to sociocultural, sociopolitical, and socioeconomic issues, yet interactions also happen at sea. Some questions addressed in this essay are: How are fishermen’s work and lives historically viewed and understood? Why is this fisherman’s important to the field of DH? How does this fisherman construct his bathymetry/map with geographical and fishing information? And why we should distinguish between map-creating and map-reading in terms of readable/encoded knowledge?
