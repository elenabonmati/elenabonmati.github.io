I plan to examine magazines and journals, instead of erotic and anarchist novels and novelettes because of copyright issues, in addition, these magazines and journals had a broader public and they were cheaper. Indeed, through their numerous publications in the press, one can identify the themes and the topics related to sexuality.<p>My aim is to create a computer readable corpus of these erotic and anarchist magazines and journals, and second, to explore how anarchist movement and erotic literature influenced the population at the time. One of the questions that I want to answer is: How does a social and political movement, such as the anarchist movement, have relations to erotic literature? For that purpose, I plan to use topic modeling to establish topics and relations among erotic and anarchist materials to determine the influence on erotic fiction of the anarchists’ popularization of prevalent sexology through their magazines and journals.<p><img src="/assets/images/collage.jpg" alt="Collage" title="Collage" /><h4 id="epistemology-of-the-sea-fishermans-local-knowledge-2017"><a href="https://umiami.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=6d28d3b47f584d9795457d281c019420">Epistemology of the Sea: Fisherman’s local knowledge</a> (2017)</h4><p>My main argument acknowledges why local knowledge produced by a fisherman in digital form matters and is relevant to the field of DH. Thus, I present this fisherman as a DH expert on the sea. Over the years, he has gathered, combined, collected, produced, created, and stored a great amount of information/data about his fishing areas and his surroundings in the Mediterranean Sea. In the study of spatial analysis, mapping has mostly focused on land and landscapes with regard to sociocultural, sociopolitical, and socioeconomic issues, yet interactions also happen at sea. Some questions addressed in this essay are: How are fishermen’s work and lives historically viewed and understood? Why is this fisherman’s important to the field of DH? How does this fisherman construct his bathymetry/map with geographical and fishing information? And why we should distinguish between map-creating and map-reading in terms of readable/encoded knowledge? <img src="/assets/images/fishermen.png" alt="Fishermans" title="Fisherman" /></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; <span class="full-year"></span> Elena Bonmatí Gonzálvez</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
