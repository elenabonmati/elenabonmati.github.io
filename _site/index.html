I conducted my undergraduate studies in English Studies at the University of Alicante (2009) in Spain during which I had the opportunity to study abroad for a year at Manchester Metropolitan University (UK) and for a semester at the University of South Australia at Adelaide (Australia). Also, I earned a Master’s in Teaching English as a Foreign Language from the University of Alicante (2010) and an MA in Spanish from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (2014).<p><p> My areas of research and teaching are nineteenth-, twentieth- and twenty-first century Spanish literature, cultural studies, queer theory, and digital humanities (DH). In my dissertation, I focus on the popularity of Spanish “sicalipsis” (erotic popular literature) in early twentieth-century Spain and its intersections with the anarchist movement.<p><p> I have been fortunate to teach at different types of institutions of higher education in the USA and the UK; from liberal arts college settings at the first Historically Black University (HBCU) in the USA (Lincoln University, PA), to larger research university settings and urban areas such as Knoxville (TN), Miami (FL), and Manchester (UK). I have taught all levels of the Spanish curriculum, from beginning to advanced language and up to advanced literature and culture courses, having also participated in community-based teaching initiatives. My experience ranges from working as a teaching assistant for professors of Spanish literature courses in Manchester Metropolitan University (UK) to being the sole instructor of undergraduate university classes at the introductory, intermediate and advanced levels at the University of Tennessee and UM. Recently, I have been fortunate to co-teach two advanced literature courses at UM and to experience mentored-teaching at UM.<p><p> I have ample experience coordinating and participating in numerous community-based activities. Most recently, my community outreach involves volunteering for and participating actively in LGBTQI cultural groups by giving talks and organizing educational activities at different high schools in the Valencia Region of Spain during the summers.<p></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; <span class="full-year"></span> Elena Bonmatí Gonzálvez</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
